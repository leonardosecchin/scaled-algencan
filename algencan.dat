# 'OPTSCALE-MAX-FACTOR' is the maximum value for the optimality
# scale factor. The default value is 1e+20. If a value less
# than 1.0 is provided, it will be set to 1.0.

#OPTSCALE-MAX-FACTOR 1e+20

# To use the original Algencan, i.e., without scaling the final
# solution, uncomment the line below.

All instructions contained in the original README file of Algencan 3.1.1
remain valid, except for the compilation of BLAS, HSL and Metis packages.

The modified Makefile was developed to unpack and compile the HSL and Metis
packages if they are provided by the user. BLAS routines must be present.
